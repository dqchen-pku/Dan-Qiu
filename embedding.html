              (from Killingsworth et al., 2013, PNAS)</font></p>
            <p class="text add-top-margin">
              Mass-independently 17O-depleted in barite sulfate at the aftermath of the Neoproterozoic Marinoan Snowball Earth(~635Ma) is considered 
                    as a record of ultra-high pCO2, which may be the highest level in the past 750Ma. The Marinoan Oxygen-17 Depletion Event (MOSD) is regarded 
                    as a global event because it was an atmospheric phenomenon. Geologists have found evidences from Australia, northeast Svalbard and Africa 
                    are consistent with MOSD being a global event. However, data reported in Killingsworth at. al. (2013) show that records in Hubei, 
                    South China Block, display a temporal variation including a brief disappearance and a later reappearance in ∆17O, which is not consistent 
                    with predicted global atmospheric processes (Cao and Bao, 2013). Our hypothesis is that the observed temporal variation is a local phenomenon, 
                    caused by a local sulfate dilution event rather than an atmospheric event. The hypothesis predicts that the same excursion may not be observed 
                    in a different location where the degree of sulfate dilution is likely different. To test the hypothesis, we must find a section where barite 
                    layers are similarly abundant as those in the Wushanhu section but is distance away. We have located such a section: the Longxi Cun section in 
                    Shengnongjia, Hubei Province, which is about 20km east of the Wushanhu section studied by Killingsworth et al (2013). We are going to test the 
                    △17O in barite sulfate deposited in the cap carbonate using a sequence of HCl and DTPA dissolution and reprecipitation (DDARP) treatment, 
                    along with testing the δ13C record to calibrate the specific MOSD period, in order to make the comparison to the outcomes of Killingsworth et al.

            <p class="text add-top-margin">
              We try to constrain the pressure of feldspar crystallization of arc magma around the global ocean-continent boundary, which is critical to investigate 
              the magma evolution process during building continental crust. Eu is expected to substitute into plagioclase since the partition coefficient of Eu(II) is 
              much more positive in plagioclase than Sm(III) and Gd(III), leading to the Eu depletion of the residual magma. We take advantage of the GEOROC database 
              to establish a modern global arc dataset and track Eu/Eu* with magma evolution based on this assumption. By applying pMELTS software, we especially select 
              Mariana(oceanic arc), Tonga(oceanic arc), East Aleutian(oceanic-continental arc), and South Andes(continental arc) as our primary experimental settings. 
              The results indicate that for most oceanic arcs with shallow crusts, such as Mariana and Tonga, plagioclase can crystallize under the pressure of 5-6kbar, 
              while the H2O content is restricted to 3±1wt%. The continental arc with relatively thick crusts, always rich in water, plagioclase will saturate when the magma 
              transports into the mid-upper crust. It represents that the continental arc magma will rapidly evolve into felsic once reaching the middle crust and crystallize
              batch in magma chambers at different depths. It can be regarded as a new tryout other than traditional high-pressure petrological methods.
